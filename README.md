About

This is a thought experiment to come up with ways to address a lack of connection these days. Made in a few days to get a base, runs on local storage only. The platform is intended for use as an outlet for hard times - nothing with high commitment, but a way to look back on times in your life, or see how other people are handling things. 


Next Steps include:
- adding a liking system(can already filter to see if you posted).
- being able to generate individual card pages for more info and maybe comments
